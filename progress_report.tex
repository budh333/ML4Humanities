\title{ML for Humanities: Progress Report}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\paragraph{Introduction} The following is a short description of the tasks we were able to complete while following the Coursera course as well as the obstacles we encountered along the way. There are two reasons for giving this description: First, to give Arianna and Veruska a better overview over what the group of students has done. Second, to give some pointers as to what worked and what did not in case the project \emph{ML for Humanities} should become a regular thing. The report proceeds by week, first specifying what we planned to do and then what we actually managed to do and what difficulties arose.
\paragraph{Week 1} \underline{What we planned to do:}\\
Follow weeks one to three of the online course. This includes the following topics: Introduction to ML in general, Introduction to Linear Algebra, Simple Linear Regression, Multivariate Linear Regression, Logistic Regression.\\
We planned to implement three things: The Simple Linear Regression, the Multivariate Linear Regression and the Logistic Regression\\
\underline{What we did:} We followed the first three weeks of the course individually. We mostly managed to implement the Simple and Multivariate models, but only parts of the Logistic Regression because we ran out of time.
\paragraph{Week 2} \underline{What we planned to do:}\\
Follow weeks four, five and seven of the online course. This includes the following topics: Introduction to Neural Networks, Representation in Neural Networks, Training Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines. Additionally, we decided to try out pairwise coding as a working technique. We formed groups of two people each; one of the partners would code while the other had the task of supervising the coding process.\\
We planned to implement three things: First, toy NN which is able to represent binary logical operators, when provided with the correct parameters/weights beforehand. Second, an implementation of the same toy NN that would be able to learn parameters from labeled training data. Third, a Support Vector Model.\\
\underline{What we did:} We followed all the course work. Both groups were able to code up a working NN for all binary logical operators. Both groups got stuck in the task of training the NN.
